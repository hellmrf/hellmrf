## Heliton Martins

Computational Chemistry undergraduate student at Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG). Programmer and Julia Lang enthusiast.

I began programming when I was 10 years old. After realize that I just can't do web design (it was called so), I moved to backend. Then I realized I don't like it very much. I found my field in Computational Chemistry, where I can mix my programming with some physics and math just to bring chemistry to life (or to _silico_).

### My programming knowledge
Currently, I use three languages almost all the time, so I'm very comfortable with:
- Python
- Julia
- LaTeX

I also use some other languages when I need them:
- C++
- Typescript (and therefore Javascript in legacy projects)

I have very basic knowledge on these:
- Rust
- MATLABâ“‡
- Bash

### My research fields
Although still student, I'm involved in many research projects (Scientific Initiation). Currently, I work with:
- Development of [QSARModelingPy](https://github.com/hellmrf/QSARModelingPy), a Python package and software program for build and validate [QSAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_structure%E2%80%93activity_relationship) models ([link](https://proceedings.science/rasbq-2020/papers/qsarmodelingpy--a-python-package-to-build-and-validate-qsar-models-));
- Validation of a new methodology for QSAR descriptors extraction ([link](https://proceedings.science/sbqt-2021/papers/lqtagridhull-and-lqtagrid-for-4d-qsar-descriptors-calculation--a-comparative-study));
- Application of Neural Networks in Thermal Analysis (with funding of [CNPq](https://www.gov.br/cnpq/pt-br); [link](https://www.ufmg.br/semanadoconhecimento/page-poster/?id=39037));
- Application of Neural Networks on the judicial area to predict pending time of bills (still not submited);
- Development of a novel application to the calculation of Permitted Daily Exposure (PDE);
- Development of an educational mobile game for high school chemistry students.

### My interests
I'm very interested in Computational Chemistry, Theoretic Chemistry, and Physical Chemistry. Computer Science is another field I like very much.
